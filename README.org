* the Triangulator
  definition viewer
  with examples and theorems

** overview
   using the triangle to illuminate geometric ideas
   telling a story, the story of the triangle
   illustrating ideas of symmetry

   interactive movies
   animated definitions, examples, theorems
   text equations and symbols along with graphics, coordinated wtih
   color in time
   with sound

   map progress through the territory

   current definition, example, theorem
   text box
   graphics box
   definition box

   a sequence of steps
   text and graphics
   play, step through, replay
   like a debugger
   color coordinated
   symbols and graphics
   mouse over, or touch, to higlight a graphical element

   using the language of geometry and symmetry

   click a definition
   walk through or let it run
   replay forward and backward
   edit the general objects, like points, that are used in the
   definition, example or theorem

   walk through the steps of a proof
   expand, collapse a proof
   see the overview
   see the details

   ability to add and edit items
   abiility to test
   ability to create challenge exercises based on user history
   store user activity
  
** workflow
   interactive design
   interactive programming

   browser -> google chrome
   develop prototype that works on chrome first
   first with html and css then using hiccup and garden

   use garden to generate other browser prefixs
   treat css and javascript as targets generated from clojure
   targeted to the browser env
   also run on node, possibly

   clojure repl
   clojurescript repl, connected to browser

   step through or play

   graphics coordinated with text
   in color in time

   app-state: current definition
   local state: current step

   mouseover or tap on symbol
   highlight graphical element


   (point x y)

** ideas
*** give Point some style
*** change Line rendering to render its points also
    using their style
    give some style to the line as well
*** add notation
    optionally give items a name
    that uses the items style
    
*** add hilightibility
    mouse over to highlight
    symbol and graphic
