* the Triangulator
  definition viewer
  with examples and theorems

** overview
   use the triangle to illuminate geometric ideas
   tel a story, the story of the triangle
   illustrate ideas of symmetry

   an interactive movie with
   animated definitions, examples, theorems
   mouse over, or touch, to higlight a graphical element
   color coordinated
   symbols and graphics abd sounds   

   current definition, example, theorem
   text box
   graphics box
   definition box

   a sequence of steps
   text and graphics
   play, step through, replay
   like a debugger

   use the language of geometry and symmetry
   the transforms which preserves distance, isometries

   click a definition
   walk through or let it run
   replay forward and backward
   edit the general objects, like points, that are used in the
   definition, example or theorem

   walk through the steps of a proof
   expand, collapse a proof
   see the overview
   see the details

   ability to add and edit items
   abiility to test
   ability to create challenge exercises based on user history
   store user activity
  
** workflow
   interactive design
   interactive programming

   browser -> google chrome
   develop prototype that works on chrome first
   first with html and css then using hiccup and garden

   use garden to generate other browser prefixs
   treat css and javascript as targets generated from clojure
   targeted to the browser env
   also run on node, possibly

   clojure repl
   clojurescript repl, connected to browser

   graphics represented as data
   ideas from yantra, session

   view definition

   #/centroid
   #/perp-bisector

   graphics coordinated with text
   in color in time

   app-state: current definition
   local state: current step

   mouseover or tap on symbol
   highlight graphical element

** ideas
*** give Point some style
    an ordered color set
    1 2 3 4 5  ...
    
*** change Line rendering to render its points also
    using their style
    give some style to the line as well
*** add notation
    optionally give items a name
    that uses the items style
    
*** add hilightibility
    mouse over to highlight
    symbol and graphic

*** add interacive guides
**** line
     two points
     show midpoint when drawing a line, along with perpendicular
     bisector

     show circles centered at endpoints as well as centered at radius

     extend line in both directions
**** two lines
     find the intersection of two lines
     or if they are paalell

     find the angles between them
     bisect the angles between them
     
**** triangle
     illuminate special triangles and snap to exact spot
     equilateral
     isosceles
     right
     golden
     
**** geometric concepts
     distance from a point
     distance between two points
     distance bewteen a point and a line
     distance between two lines
     angle between two lines
