* circle of fifths
  Pythagorean Circle
  pitch frequencies
  vibrating strings of various length
  an octave
  assign a pitch to each of the 12 points around a circle
  approximate 12 half steps of an octave in the present system
  unnit of measure is cnets
  1200 cents equals one octave
  each half step has 100 cents
