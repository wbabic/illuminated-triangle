* Introduction to sketching
  Sketching with css and clojure ... in the canvas
  making geometrical objects
  with visual representation and
  represented by data
  
** a five hundred square pixel canvas
   screen coordinates
   bit map

   represent as a matrix in core.matrix
   
** create geometric data with your fingers
   mouse
   touch
   
** finger painting with geometric objects
   point line circle triangle
   with effects and guides
   in color and time
   
** make triangles
   create point triples
   each point with a pair of coordinates

** analyze
   save data in a file
   send to server

** isometry
   a congruent transformation
   
   from Coxeter

*** transformation
    transformation
    a one-to-one correspondence
    P -> P'
    amoung all points in the plane (or space)

    a rule for associating points
    each pair has a first point P and a second member P'
    every point occurs as the first member of just one pair

    when P' coincides with P we have what is called an invariant point

    product of transformations
    identiy and inverse

*** Isometry
    a length preserving transformation
    if (P, P') and (Q, Q') are two pairs of corresponding points then
    PQ = P'Q'
    that is, PQ and P'Q' are congruent segments

    rotation
    about a point in the plane, a line in space
    has an invariant point or invariant line

    halfturn
    rotation by 180 degrees
    involution
   
    translation
    or parallel displacement
    does not have an invariant point

    reflection
    invariant mirror line or plane in 2d 3d
   
*** 2.31 an isometry with 2 invariant points (or more)
    If an isometry has more than one invariant point, it must be
    either the identity or a reflection

**** proof
     Let A and B be two invariant points, and P be any point not on AB

     Let P' be the image of P by an isometry, then we know
     AP = AP' and BP = BP'

     intersection of two circles
     center at A radius AP
     center at B radius BP
     when P is not on AB
     has two points

     it would have just one point if P were on AB
     a tangent point
     
** symmetry
*** symmetry of a triangle

    one line of reflection in the plane
    isosceles

    three lines of reflection
    equilateral

    reflection along edge
    altitude base point
    line through vertex
    perpendicular to opposite edge

*** regular polygon
    the dihedral group
    
*** regular polyhedron
    platonic solids
