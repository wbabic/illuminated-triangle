* Introduction to sketching
  Sketching with css and clojure ... in the canvas
  making geometrical objects
  with visual representation and
  represented by data
  
** a five hundred square pixel canvas
   screen coordinates
   bit map

   represent as a matrix in core.matrix
   
** create geometric data with your fingers
   mouse
   touch
   
** finger painting with geometric objects
   point line circle triangle
   with effects and guides
   in color and time
   
** make triangles
   create point triples
   each point with a pair of coordinates

** analyze
   save data in a file
   send to server
** isometry
   congruent transformation
   
   from Coxeter

   Regular Polygons
   Isometry

   a length preserving transformation
   if (P, P') and (Q, Q') are two pairs of corresponding points then
   PQ = P'Q'
   that is, PQ and P'Q' are congruent segments

   transformation
   a one-to-one correspondence
   P -> P'
   amoung all points in the plane (or space)

   a rule for associating points
   each pair has a first point P and a second member P'
   every point occurs as the first member of just one pair

   when P' coincides with P we have what is called an invariant point

   product of transformations
   identiy and inverse
   
   rotation
   about a point in the plane, a line in space
   has a an invariant point ot invariant line

   halfturn
   rotation by 180 degrees
   
   translation has no invariant points
   or parallel displacement

   reflection
   invariant mirror line or plane in 2d 3d
   
*** 2.31
    If an isometry has more than one invariant point, it must be
    either the identity or a reflection

**** proof
     Let A and B be two invariant points, and P not on any point on
     the line AB.

     diagram
     AP BP

     Let P' be the image of P by an isometry, then we know
     AP = AP' and BP = BP'

     two circles
     center at A radius AP
     center at B radius BP

** symmetry
