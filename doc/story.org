* coordinate systems
** Earth centered coordinates
** being centered coordinates
** flat landers
   beings that, due to gravity, are mostly restricted to a plane existence
   living in a mostly flat world
   thinking mostly flat thoughts
   ever since Euclid
   occasionally delving into solids, 
   with only a special few that explore higher dimensions
   of curved space, Einstein being one

   they once thought the whole Earth flat
   thinking they would fall off the edge if they went too far

   they do sometimes rise up above the ground in machines 
   but seldom do they adventure into the space of the Earth
   although a few have traveled into the oceans

   those who seek adventure flock to the mountains
   using the gradient for acceleration and thrill

   there was of one particular surface being who liked to explore

   who found the idea of infinitely flat space quite boring

   he was familiar with isometry
   and even about similarity
   and how to transform himself while preserving
   the lengths of his edges or at least the ratios

   he could reflect on his edge, or on any other line
   and change his orientation,
   becoming his mirror image
   and then reflect himself back again

   he was aware of congruent images of himself
   and knew how to find the transformation
   relating him to any other family member 
   in the family of congruent equilateral triangles

   this is the story of when, upon encountering his circumcircle, 
   he reflected on it and,
   inverted himself about it
   exchanging his center for infinity
   and of what happened when he tried to tell other triangles of his
   experience

   of course, needless to say, they thought he was crazy

   this was after he told them that they were only a change of perspective 
   away from the scalene family
   who did not even possess a single line of reflection
   whereas the equilaterals possessed three

   so I should say,
   they though him even crazier than before,
   when he told them infinity is within
   their very own circumcenter
  
   what's that?
   oh, you haven't heard about the scalene incidence?
   okay, maybe we should start there first
